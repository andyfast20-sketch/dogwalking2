      <h2>Who I am</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m Andy — a local, independent dog walker. I’m DBS checked, fully insured with public liability cover, and trained in canine first aid. I keep walks calm, positive and tailored to your dog’s needs.</p>

      <h2>How I work</h2>
      <p>Every dog is different. I offer one‑to‑one walks for focus and gentle pacing, and small paired walks for well‑matched dogs who enjoy company. You’ll receive photo and GPS updates after every outing.</p>

      <h2>What I offer</h2>
      <ul class="services-list">
        <li><strong>Daily Walks:</strong> 30–60 minutes, paced to your dog</li>
        <li><strong>Puppy Visits:</strong> Short, frequent visits to build routine</li>
        <li><strong>Senior Care:</strong> Gentle routes with extra patience</li>
        <li><strong>Small Paired Walks:</strong> When dogs are well‑matched</li>
        <li><strong>Check‑ins:</strong> Water, toilet breaks and a little company</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>DBS checked:</strong> Vetted and trustworthy</li>

      <h2>My promise</h2>
      <p>I’ll treat your dog as if they were my own — with patience, consistency and a lot of care. My goal is a happy, well‑exercised dog and total peace of mind for you.</p>
